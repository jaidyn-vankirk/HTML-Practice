    <h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:luminari; color:white;"> Biography of Captain Jaidyn</h1>
    <p style="font-family:luminari;">Captain Jaidyn was born with super strength. She was always the smallest in her grade, but her strength made up for her height. Her power was discovered when she was play-fighting with her brothers. At the age of 4, she had the ability to pin both her 10 and 12-year-old brother down at the same time. When she went to daycare, the boys were even scared to play with her because she was so rough. Finally, at 5, her parents took her to the doctor, and they discovered she was more powerful than a grown man. Her strength grew with her. By 12, it looked like she was flying when she jumped off the ground. Today she can travel the length of an entire city when she jumps and break down a three-story building with one kick.</p>
